# Description of the project 
FLEXI-FRAME (Flexible Irradiation Frame System) is a modular system of movable frames, which can be used to irradiate samples as for example shielding materials, with a particle beam, such as a proton beam. Thanks to its modular structure you can stuck as many frames as you want! It is possible to place a material under tests on the frames and then remotely subsequently put the next layers of the material in the beam. It allows you to check how the transmission changes without accessing the irradiation room many times, which helps to save expensive beam time and reduce unnecessary exposure of personnel to residual radiation.
