# How to assemble a frame?
You need to connect rack holder-top and rack holder-bottom together. Then using the M2 x 10 mm screws attach servo to the rack holder. <br /> <br />
The pinion gear needs also some modifications. To make a working pinion gear you need to take one of the horns, which are usually available together with the servo, and cut the arm, such that only the round part remains. It is probably the best to take the horn with only one arm, shown on the left photo below. After that this round part needs to be placed in the hole in the pinion gear - as presented on the right photo below.<br />
